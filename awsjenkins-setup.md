Step-by-Step Instructions:
1. Prepare AWS Environment
Create an AWS Account:

If you don't already have one, sign up for an AWS account.
Set Up IAM Role and User:

Create an IAM Role:
Navigate to the IAM service in AWS Management Console.
Create a new role with EC2 service as trusted entity.
Attach the following necessary policies: AmazonEC2FullAccess, AmazonS3FullAccess, AmazonVPCFullAccess, CloudWatchFullAccess.
Create an IAM User:
Create a new IAM user with programmatic access.
Attach the AdministratorAccess policy to the user.
Save the userâ€™s access key and secret key securely.
Configure Security Groups:

Create a Security Group for your Jenkins server.
Allow SSH (port 22) and HTTP (port 80) inbound traffic.
Allow inbound traffic to port 8080 (default Jenkins port).
2. Launch EC2 Instance
Choose an Amazon Machine Image (AMI):

Select a suitable Linux distribution (e.g., Amazon Linux 2, Ubuntu).
Choose an Instance Type:

For a minimal setup, t2.micro (part of the AWS Free Tier) is sufficient. For larger workloads, consider t3.medium or t3.large.
Configure Instance Details:

Attach the IAM role created earlier to the instance.
Ensure the instance is launched in a public subnet for internet access.
Add Storage:

An 8 GB general-purpose SSD (gp2) is sufficient for a basic setup. Adjust as needed.
Add Tags:

Tag your instance for identification (e.g., Key: Name, Value: Jenkins-Server).
Configure Security Group:

Assign the security group created earlier to the instance.
Launch and Connect:

Launch the instance.
Connect to the instance using SSH.
3. Install Jenkins
Install Java:

Jenkins requires Java. Update the package manager and install Java (OpenJDK).
Add Jenkins Repository:

Add the Jenkins repository to your package manager.
Install Jenkins:

Update your package manager and install Jenkins.
Start Jenkins Service:

Enable and start the Jenkins service.
Adjust Firewall Rules:

Ensure the firewall allows traffic to ports 8080 and 22.
4. Initial Jenkins Setup
Access Jenkins Web Interface:

Open your web browser and navigate to http://<Your-EC2-Instance-Public-IP>:8080.
Unlock Jenkins:

Retrieve the initial admin password from the /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword file on your EC2 instance.
Enter the password on the Jenkins web interface to unlock Jenkins.
Customize Jenkins:

Install suggested plugins.
Create an admin user and complete the setup.
5. Configure Jenkins for Optimal Use
Install Essential Plugins:

Install plugins such as Git, Pipeline, AWS Credentials, and CloudBees AWS CodeBuild.
Configure Global Tool Configuration:

Set up necessary tools like Git and JDK.
Set Up Credentials:

Add AWS credentials (access key and secret key) to Jenkins Credentials for accessing AWS resources.
Create and Manage Jobs:

Create a new job using the pipeline or freestyle project.
Configure build steps to execute your sample script (e.g., a simple Python script).
6. Ensure Security and Maintenance
Enable Automatic Backups:

Set up job to backup Jenkins configuration and jobs to S3.
Enable Monitoring:

Integrate with AWS CloudWatch for monitoring Jenkins server health and logs.
Regular Updates:

Regularly update Jenkins and its plugins to the latest versions.
Final Steps
Documentation:

Document every step in a markdown file named awsjenkins-setup.md.
Commit and Push:

Add the markdown file to your repository.
Commit with a descriptive message and push to the remote repository.
Pull Request:

Create a pull request to merge your changes into the main branch.
By following these steps, you will set up a robust and scalable Jenkins server on AWS, ready for continuous integration tasks and competitive programming test cases.
